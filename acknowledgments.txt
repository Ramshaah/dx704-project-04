DX704 Week 4 Project — Acknowledgments

Outside help:
- None beyond course materials and standard library/documentation.

Libraries used (beyond those explicitly mentioned in the module):
- pandas: data loading, joins/reshaping, writing TSVs.
- numpy: numeric arrays, linear algebra helpers.
- scikit-learn (sklearn.linear_model.Ridge): ridge regression with fit_intercept=False.

Generative AI usage:
- Tool: ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) by OpenAI.
- Purpose: Assisted with drafting code cells for Parts 1–6 (data prep, ridge model, LinUCB bounds and online updates) and this acknowledgments file. I reviewed/edited code and verified outputs locally.


Notes:
- All final decisions, parameter choices, and submitted results are my own. I verified the correctness of the generated code and outputs before submission.
